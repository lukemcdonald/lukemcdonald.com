intro: |
  Senior software engineer with a front-end focus and full-stack flexibility. I specialize in building performant, accessible, and maintainable web interfaces using modern tools like React and TypeScript, while also being comfortable working across backend systems with PHP, Node.js, GraphQL, and SQL.

  With over 15 years of experience — including as a tech lead and business owner — I bring more than just technical skills. I understand how design, development, and product goals intersect. I’ve led component library architecture, shipped cross-functional tools, mentored engineers, and helped scale both startups and established teams. I thrive in roles where thoughtful UI meets practical engineering.
