intro: |
  Hands-on <strong>Tech Lead</strong> with <strong>15+ years of experience</strong> building <strong>scalable frontend platforms</strong>, guiding engineering standards, and enabling teams to ship faster with higher quality. My work centers on practical, measurable improvements—<strong>cutting delivery cycles by 80%</strong>, <strong>improving critical funnel performance by ~40%</strong>, and establishing systems and patterns that keep teams aligned and efficient.

  I specialize in modern frontend architecture (<strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>), <strong>design systems</strong>, <strong>advanced observability</strong>, and leading the adoption of <strong>AI-augmented development workflows</strong> that elevate engineering velocity rather than compromise it.
