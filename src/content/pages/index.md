I'm Luke, a passionate software engineer from beautiful [Eastern Iowa](https://goo.gl/h2EmHJ) with a
passion for creating accessible web experiences and a strong foundation in both web and graphic
design. My work is guided by my
[Christian faith](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+18%3A3&version=ESV), which
shapes how I approach my career, relationships, and service to others.
