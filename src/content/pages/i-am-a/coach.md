<strong>Wrestling</strong> has been a large part of my life from the time of my youth, into high school, college and now. I have coached a range of athletes from youth club programs up through High School for 15+ years. I love the sport of wrestling, but I specifically enjoy coaching the entire athlete: [Body, Mind, and Spirit](https://3dinstitute.com/).
