For 33 years I lived life on my own terms while attempting to fullfill the world's standards of success, morality, and purpose. In the end, I found that no matter how much of the world's goods or praises I obtained, it was all empty. It was there, in
[the valley](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/the-valley-of-vision/), I found life and purpose. God opened my eyes to my own
[sin and judgement](https://www.esv.org/Romans+1:18%E2%80%9332;Romans+2:5%E2%80%9311;Romans+3:23;Romans+3:2%E2%80%934;Revelation+21:8;Proverbs+6:16%E2%80%9319;Revelation+20:11%E2%80%9315;Hebrews+10:30%E2%80%9331;Psalm+111:10;Proverbs+1:7;Proverbs+9:10/),
