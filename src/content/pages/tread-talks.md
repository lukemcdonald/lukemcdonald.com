[TREAD Talks](https://gettreadtalks.com/) began as a way to save sermons I listened to while walking on the treadmill. As I shared them, others wanted to listen too. Itâ€™s now a place to discover, revisit, and favorite meaningful sermons. I built it to blend content I enjoy with tools I wanted to create. Users can sign up and favorite their own sermons.
